Barotropic Flow Across Bump
===========================

This repository contains setup files and analysis of a number of 2D MITgcm simulations of flow across a ridge/bump.

The figure shows a snapshot from the non-hydrostatic run B6 with horizontal velocity (left), vertical velocity (center) and turbulent dissipation (right) and isopycnals on top.

B3
--
Velocity 0.02m/s, bump height H=500m and stratification N=1e-3s^-1. Hydrostatic.
